ABSTRACT In the current electrical load profile analysis, considering the shortage of traditional methods
on the typical load profile extraction of single consumers and the load profile feature extraction, this paper
proposes an approach based on time series data mining. Firstly, this method reduces the dimension of the
load profile of a single consumer based on the Piecewise Aggregate Approximation(PAA), and re-expresses
the load profile of the consumer over a period based on the Symbolic Aggregate approXimation(SAX),
representing the consumerâ€™s load profile with a symbolic string to extract the typical load profile. Then,
combined with the load characteristic indices and time series-based features, the typical load profiles of
different consumers are clustered based on the K-means algorithm to analyze the power consumption
behaviors. Finally, this paper performs a case analysis with a UCI test data set, and the results show that
the proposed approach can excavate typical power consumption behaviors of consumers and improve the
electrical load profile analysis efficiency and the clustering quality.
