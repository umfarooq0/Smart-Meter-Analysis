This paper utilises PAA, SAX and develops statistical features which are focused on energy consumption data and uses k-means clustering to cluster them. 


### simple_ae.py 
This file builds a simple auto-encoder using neural networks to extract features from the time-series to be ued for clustering. 


### vae_cnn.py 

This file utilises variational encoder to extract features from the time series to be ued for clustering.
